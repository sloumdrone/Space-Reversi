# Space Reversi

Space Reversi is an implementation of Othello in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. This project was completed during a hackathon event. 

#### Deployment/Implementation

All libraries are included and deployment should work out of the box on an Apache or Apache-like server (anythhing that will serve static files). The game is also playable locally by dowbloading/cloning this repo and opening the index.html file in your browser of choice.
