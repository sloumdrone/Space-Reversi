# Space Reversi
Space Reversi is an implementation of Othello in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. This implementation will keep score, determine validity of moves (and prevent illegal moves), show available moves, and declare a winner when the game is over. There are two available modes: 

1) User vs CPU, which pairs the human palyer with an AI opponent. At present the AI is fairly dumb, but will always play legal moves. The team hopes to update the AI in the near future to actually take full board position into consideration when playing.

2) User vs User, in which two human players compete with each other from the same device. There are hopes to  restructure the code and add web socket connections and a waiting room with anonymous "log-in" (tokenization) to pair users for remote games.

## Deployment/Implementation

All libraries are included and deployment should work out of the box on an Apache or Apache-like server (anythhing that will serve static files). The game is also playable locally by dowbloading/cloning this repo and opening the index.html file in your browser of choice.
